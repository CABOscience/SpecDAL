Specdal Pipeline Script
=======================

Specdal provides a command line script ''specdal_pipeline'' for batch
processing of spectral data files in a directory. A typical input to
''specdal_pipeline'' is a directory containing spectral files
(i.e. .asd files), which will be converted into .csv files and figures
of spectra. User can provide arguments to customize the processing
operations (i.e. jump correction, groupby) and output (i.e. .csv file
of group means). This page describes the usage and provides examples.
